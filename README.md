# BSidesPRSun
Welcome to BSides Puerto Rico 2024!!! We were happy to have the opportunity to create this year's badge! 

# Functionality
The badge has a default color pattern but we made it highly configurable on purpose. We would love to see all the custom color schemes that people come up with! Come see us to learn more about how you can modify the badge! 

# Troubleshooting
Come find one of the makers on the back of the badge if you have any issues. We will be speaking in the Main Hall (104 B & C) from 1405-1435 on Friday and conducting workshops in 102B on Saturday from 1010-1125. 

Please note that if the badge is running consistently, the battery life will be limited.
